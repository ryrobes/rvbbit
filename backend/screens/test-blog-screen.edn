   "Create a hyperrealistic image of a beautiful full-figured woman in her late 20s, of Irish descent, standing amidst the haunting scenery of a dystopian cyberpunk northeastern America, consumed by the gnarled overgrowth of a New England forest. The scene is steeped in a moody, melancholic atmosphere dominated by neon hues of pink, purple, and light blue, nestling in a stormy, rainy ambiance. The woman gazes directly into the camera, her long hair cascading down and her high-quality, intricate neck tattoos displayed prominently.   The atmosphere is gritty, breathing life into the combined aesthetic of cyberpunk and vaporwave. An air of defiance clings to her, an invitation or a challenge for you to join her world. A rabbit necklace graces her neck while matching intricate rabbit tattoos adorn her skin. Her lips are full and pouty, adding to her voluptuous charm and subtle pinup style. Her makeup runs down her face from the rain and humidity. ",
