      " It was a few years ago on a cold, early winter morning.  There was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside.  My mother has a habit of looking out the bathroom window early in the morning.  On this cold winter morning, with the landscaped dressed in a blanket of white and without any visible signs of being touched by human or animal footprints, she saw what looked like 3 very large humanoid footprints. It was so strange that my mother made me get up to take a look.  We put our coats on and went outside to investigate.  We couldn''t believe our eyes.  There in the snow were 3 very, very large humanoid footprints.  We couldn''t figure out where they came from or where they went.  It literally looked as it came from no where and went no where, because the footprints did not leave a trail.  The footprints were so large I could almost stand in it.  You could literally see the 5 toes with foot and toe imprints in the snow.  We couldn''t believe what we were seeing.  Who or what has a foot that big and who or what would be out in this weather barefooted.<BR><BR>"

      " April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don''t go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of \"Lewis and Clarked\" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn''t recognize any landmarks. <BR><BR>I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction).<BR>As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn''t need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I''d estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn''t possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don''t know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn''t stumble once. I didn''t hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total."

I came into the living room to tell him something, as I was leaning over him,something caught my attention out of my periphiel vision. I saw what looked like two red spots at the _top of my blinds on our living room window. I turned to look at it further and soon the two red spots formed eyes, very large eyes, I kept watching from where I stood and the eyes looked right at me,we were looking at each other. I wasn''t frightened,just astonished to what I was seeing,and then what ever it was it turned it''s head and walked away from my window. Just to state a fact of point,my mini-blinds were white, down all the way and the blinds themselves were folding downward,so,anyone outside can see in,but,if they are up you can''t see in. Mind you,Our moble home is 14'' high and 70''long on two acres of land in a rual area.outside of Montrose,PA.

     " Hiking the Seven Sisters Trail from Mt Holyoke to the Notch in the Hadley / Amherst area of Massachusetts. My hiking partner and I got to Taylor''s Notch and could hear the wind ripping through making eerie noises. We both heard a lot of whistling  and breaking branches which I initially attributed to the wind going through the rocky ledges of Taylor''s Notch. We hiked over one large hill and the wind was lessening but we realized the whistling was closer and then there were whooping noises and calls along with the whistles. The calls were going back and forth and I realized we were surrounded. We kept talking loudly hoping to scare off any animals and kept my bear spray in hand for the next mile or so. Not sure what it was but highly unusual and did not sound like a grown or baby bear,canine, coyote, mountain lion, or fox. I frequently hike and spend time outdoors. I am at a loss as to what was with us that day. I am going back soon to see if I can find more. (non-numeric average)",

He has a cement pad about 10 by 6 ft with a fence 6ft high around three sides of it. The trash cans were inside the fence.On night he heard noises out side,he got his rifle and looked out back.The porch light showed nothing near the trash cans but outside the fence he could see a shape of something so he shot up in the air.The animal ,which he could only describe as a big ape,got up and he could see it''s shouders and head above the fence.It took off as it rose up turning back towards the woods in a hurry.It tore up freshly planted bushes in it''s path. The ground left  no tracks other then in the soft dirt around the bushes.That''s the plaster cast the neighbor showed me.He gave it to the neighbor because he decided he didn''t believe in what he saw and didn''t want to be haunted by the sighting.They had the police there but I guess he made sure it was kept out of the papers.He just didn''t want his name out there. <BR>"

Never heard anything but did get a musty rank smell. The footprints were visible everywhere and had to be fresh since the ground had just been covered with snow. My brother and I were rabbit hunting at the time and were so scared we ran to the car and left immediately. At the time I was approximately 17.  Know that this is a older recall of a Bigfoot encounter or near encounter. But when my brother and I got home we were still scared stiff. Told our father about the footprints and he just laughed and asked if we had been drinking or something. About 5 years later the laugh was on him when Dad said you kids weren''t kidding were you. He had just seen the very same type of footprints in the same area. Wish we would have taken pictures at the time but then you would have been regarded as some kind of kook. Especially if you went public. Since then have talked to a few people that have seen or heard of Bigfoot sightings within a couple of miles of our encounter. <BR><BR> <BR>",

Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

      " My uncle and I were elk hunting near Fossil Ridge northeast of Gunnison, CO when this incident ocurred.  It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else."

      " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>"

     " In November 2001, I was guiding for a husband and wife team and was also accompanied by my own wife during a elk hunt. That morning we had located a herd of elk in some remote country and had stalked to their location to find that it was only cows. Since we had bull tag only we did not pursue but instead went out on the point of a mountain to glass for any potential bulls. As our party was sitting and glassing I called periodically hoping for a response from a bull. To my surprise (all of our surprise) we heard a low guttural moan. At first I thought it to be a bull bedded down but the second time I realized that it was no bull at all and could not possibly be a bear. I immediately went toward the noise to confirm what ever had made it and found no animals, no elk, deer, bear, etc. <BR><BR>Shortly after hearing and investigating the sound I moved the party up the mountain to a aspen grove where I knew mid-day bulls would visit to eat. Shortly after positioning the hunters my wife and I took a position higher up the mountain to get a better view and for calling. After sitting in the grove for less than an hour we heard logs being hit together. Not like two bulls fighting but more like someone taking a sizeable log and hitting against another. The end of the day came and we returned to the camp and the hunt was over. <BR><BR>That night two inches of snow fell and I went back to the same location and found a dead cow elk with only her chest cavity being open and from what I could tell having most of her internal organs. I am of course no expert in zoology or cryptolgy [sic] but from my best guess and knowing what I have seen from the past I think that my hunting party and I disturbed a bigfoot while hunting that morning.<BR><BR>I did find tracks but due to the sun melt the tracks were very large with no distinguishable marks. This took place only 8 to 10 miles from the previous sightings.",

     " this report is for my daughter who today thinks she saw two big creatures that looked like the  creature called bigfoot. She was pretty shook up about it.  She was so scared that she did not stop. She said the creatures were walking in a pond between Orick and Trinadad off of hwy. 101 this morning about 10:30. She said they were very close. She saw the big ones face. She said it looked like a monkey face. The other one was stooped over so she could not see him very good.<BR>",

     " I was sitting here listening to you on coast to coast and thought I''d tell you about an insident that happened in dec of 97.  the location was in the sierra navada mountains about ten miles above huntington lake which is about 60 miles above fresno in central CA.  Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

      " My uncle and I were elk hunting near Fossil Ridge northeast of Gunnison, CO when this incident ocurred.  It was late afternoon when we noticed a strong odor that we thought might be elk so we headed east toward a small ridge hoping to find one on the other side.  As we got closer we heard the noise of rocks being banged together.  As we topped the ridge we saw a large dark brown animal squatting at the edge of a dry creek bed with it''s back toward us. It was banging 2 rocks together with it''s \"hands\" and making a grunting/growling noise each time the  rocks hit.<BR><BR>It seemed to sense our presence almost immediately and turned around and looked at us.  Then it quickly stood up and jumped across the creek in one motion.  I remember thinking \"nothing can move like that!\".  It ran up the slope on the north side of the creek bed at an angle and disappeared into the pine and aspen trees farther up the hill.  We could see it for about 50 feet before it was gone from sight.  It moved real quietly for something that big.<BR><BR>I estimate it''s height as 6''5''''.  It was covered with long dark brown hair that made me think of a yak.  It had a strong smell, at least there was a strong smell in the area that was like elk urine.<BR><BR>After we calmed down a bit, we went into the creek bed and found the 2 rocks which were chipped and broken.  We looked for other signs in that place but couldn''t find anything else."

      " I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. <BR><BR>I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. <BR><BR>At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. <BR><BR>By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.<BR><BR>I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know. <BR><BR><BR><BR>"

     " In November 2001, I was guiding for a husband and wife team and was also accompanied by my own wife during a elk hunt. That morning we had located a herd of elk in some remote country and had stalked to their location to find that it was only cows. Since we had bull tag only we did not pursue but instead went out on the point of a mountain to glass for any potential bulls. As our party was sitting and glassing I called periodically hoping for a response from a bull. To my surprise (all of our surprise) we heard a low guttural moan. At first I thought it to be a bull bedded down but the second time I realized that it was no bull at all and could not possibly be a bear. I immediately went toward the noise to confirm what ever had made it and found no animals, no elk, deer, bear, etc. <BR><BR>Shortly after hearing and investigating the sound I moved the party up the mountain to a aspen grove where I knew mid-day bulls would visit to eat. Shortly after positioning the hunters my wife and I took a position higher up the mountain to get a better view and for calling. After sitting in the grove for less than an hour we heard logs being hit together. Not like two bulls fighting but more like someone taking a sizeable log and hitting against another. The end of the day came and we returned to the camp and the hunt was over. <BR><BR>That night two inches of snow fell and I went back to the same location and found a dead cow elk with only her chest cavity being open and from what I could tell having most of her internal organs. I am of course no expert in zoology or cryptolgy [sic] but from my best guess and knowing what I have seen from the past I think that my hunting party and I disturbed a bigfoot while hunting that morning.<BR><BR>I did find tracks but due to the sun melt the tracks were very large with no distinguishable marks. This took place only 8 to 10 miles from the previous sightings.",

Myself and a frind were fourwheeling on light, snow covered roads at about two am. we came around a corner and we both saw something run across the road.  it had very long, shagy red hair and it was running on all fours.  something like a gorilla would when charging.  we only observed it cross the road when we apperently spooked it.  we are both outdoorsman and have seen bears and the like befor.  when it happened, we both simultaneously looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" and then said \"we better not tell anyone or they''ll think were crazy!\"  I can''t swear to what it was, but I''ll swear it wasn''t a bear.  this thing was the wrong color to be any kind of cat and it was to thin through the torso as compared to its overall size to be a bear and i suspect bears would have already been in hybernation.  the hair looked like it could have been 18 inches long, very shagy.  its body shape was like a giant human, not a cat or bear.  unfortunately the animal never turned its face toward us at all.

   " Hello!<BR><BR>This is something that happened a long time ago and to be honest I never thought it could be connected to Sasquatch/Bigfoot but recently Ive been reading about the topic a lot and I figured Id send it to you guys after finding your site and just checking out reports from areas where Ive lived in the past. Anyway, I found a report from Belchertown, MA and I lived a rural part of Belchertown for several years when I was in college. <BR><BR>This was sometime around 1997-1998 in Belchertown. My housemates and I were out on our porch which faced a 2-3 acre meadow. This open meadow and the porch were on the east side of the house. The entire area past the meadow to the East was wooded with houses and cabins here and there for about a mile until you hit a lake. Behind the house was abput 10-20 yards of woods with a walking trail and then another 10 yards past was a train tracks running East/west then more woods. <BR><BR>Anyway, my housemates and I were out on the porch when we heard the sound of a tree crashing to the ground.  About 19 seconds later while we all were kindve shocked there was an enormously loud and guttural growl/scream/roar.  In all my life I have never heard any animal sound that could match it in intensity, volume, and it just sounded plain angry and vivacious. It is hard to describe just how loud it was and how stunned we all were that this was coming from an animal just inside the tree line.  There were coyotes, owls, foxes galore back there and the sounds they made were a world away in comparison.  <BR><BR>We all immediately looked at each other, got up and went into the house as fast as we could without saying a word. <BR><BR>Everyone assumed it was an animal but after reading about and hearing recordings of presumed Sasquatch scream and howls it brought the memory rushing back because it is so similar to what we heard. <BR><BR>Anyway, just wanted to send this in as I saw there was another report for this area. <BR><BR>Best regards ",
   :environment
   "The property was about 7 acres. Most of it a meadow but wooded in front of the street with a small creek near the road. Woods surrounded the entire property and behind the house there was a public trail and a train track running parallel East/west behind the house. To the east of the 2-3 acre was a wooded area filled with many large Birch trees. The houses in this area are mostly in the woods.",
